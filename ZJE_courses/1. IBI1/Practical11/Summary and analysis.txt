Findings:
The percentage of identical amino acids between random and human is: 5.405405405405405%
The percentage of identical amino acids between random and mouse is: 5.85585585585585%
The percentage of identical amino acids between mouse and human is: 89.63963963963964%

The score between mouse and human is: 1091
The score between mouse and random is: -250
The score between random and human is: -250

Analysis: The high alignment score and percentage of identical amino acids of human and mouse group shows that human and 
mouse SOD2 sequences are highly similar, which means that SOD2 protein is highly conserved between different species. Therefore, 
SOD2 maybe a kind of housekeeping protein. That is, the function of SOD2 protein is important for both mouse and human and it may 
participant in a basic function such enzyme for transport and energy production. The protein is not specific in one species, it is necessary
 in both mouse and human body. Additionally, we can see that the percentage and score for human-random or mouse-random are 
much lower. That shows the similarity of SOD2 is not just because of the chance.
